# Simple Text Adventure
This is a very simnple text adventure game written in Python.

This is a project included in Udacity's Intro to Programming nanodegree.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate basic knowledge of Python 
programming, including the use of functions to refactor repeated code, use 
randomness and pass variable responses to user input.

## How to use

To run this program, you will need to have Python 3 installd (preferrably Python 3.7):

1 Download the zip file or clone the repository.
~~~
git clone https://github.com/rclarkmorrow/text-adventure.git
~~~
2 Run the file "adventure_game..py"
~~~
python3 adventure_game
~~~

## To do

* Create an "actor" class with player and monster subclasses
* Put game text in a .txt file rather than a .py include
* Refactor more code into functions
